# Tensegrity 

[Latest - blog](https://tensegrity.it)

This is a suite of tools I've been building that are intended to work together. An aim is to keep them loosely coupled, as independent projects. Overall goals aren't much defined beyond enabling experimentation with interesting tech and trying to have fun in the process.
