# Tensegrity Suite

This is an open-ended set of things I've been building that are intended to work together. An aim is to keep them loosely coupled, as independent projects. Overall goals aren't much defined beyond enabling experimentation with interesting tech and trying to have fun in the process. It seems useful to have a name for them as a whole, even though the overall architecture is comparable to scraps of cardboard held together with string.

I've given myself a deadline of **2025-06-21** to get this bunch of things to some kind of minimum viable pseudo-products. If I'm happy with what I've got to show at that point, I'll be doing announcements (haranguing the lists, socials and maybe even ex-girlfriends) on **2025-07-03**. I'm more confident than usual that I'll have at least *something* to show, I have got the lion's share of the hard parts done already. We'll see.
